Simple way to transfer files

Welcome to this project.
This project is still in early development, is missing many features and is lacking in security.

To compile this project open a command prompt inside the project folder then type:
>Premake5/premake5.exe vs2022

a vs solution will be created , for now only vs2022 is supported, 
in a future implementation i will add support for other compilers
